# NKOActivityIndicatorView
A [Lyst.com](http://www.lyst.com) lookalike activity indicator for iOS.


## Installation

### CocoaPods

The best way to integrate NKOActivityIndicatorView in your project is with CocoaPods. You can find more info about this dependency manager [here](http://cocoapods.org). Just add the following line to your **Podfile**.

```
pod 'NKOActivityIndicatorView'
```

### Swift Package Manager

Alternatively you can integrate directly in Xcode using Swift Package Manager. You can find more info about this dependency manager [here](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/)

To integrate using Xcode:

File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency

Enter package URL: https://github.com/nakiostudio/NKOActivityIndicatorView

See [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) for more info 

## How does it work

**NKOActivityIndicatorView** behaviour and public interface are very similar to `UIActivityIndicatorView` ones. If you have experience working with it then you will make this component run in a couple of minutes (literally).

This example shows how to programmatically create and animate the component.
```
CGRect frame = CGRectMake(0.f, 0.f, 32.f, 32.f);

NKOActivityIndicatorView *activityIndicator = [[NKOActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];

[self.view addSubview:activityIndicator];

[activityIndicator startAnimating];
```

Simple, right?

## Customization

Unlike `UIActivityIndicatorView`, **NKOActivityIndicatorView** allows you to customize different visual attributes:
- color: sets the color of the line path.
- lineWidth: sets the line width of the line path.
- animationDuration (TODO): sets the duration of single loop iteration.
- hidesWhenStopped: calls view's setHidden when the animation is stopped.

## Example project

To help you understand a bit more how the component works you can clone this repository and try the example project.
